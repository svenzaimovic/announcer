# Welcome
Hello, welcome to the repository of my web app. I will update this file with the detailed documentation of everything I do in this project. Cheers.

# Announcer
The web app that lets professors update the schedule and send announcements

# Getting Started
Please run `npm install` before running anything

When everything is installedg run `node server.js` to run the server. The app will be available on [localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

NOTE: If you are developing, use `npm run dev` instead. That runs nodemon which automatically refreshes the page when you save a file.

# Thank you so much for reading!
